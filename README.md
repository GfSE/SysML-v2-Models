# SysML-v2-Models

This is an open and extensible collection of SysMLv2 model. This repository is
dedicated to providing a high-quality collection of SysMLv2 models. Our goal is
to create a shared resource of well-structured, reusable SysMLv2 models for
systems engineering. To do that, we carefully curate added models before they
are added to the collection. 

# Purposes
 
The purpose of this repository is to gather and curate a set of high-quality
SysMLv2 models that can be used across various domains in systems engineering.
We aim to build a diverse collection that showcases best practices and
real-world use cases of SysMLv2. 

* provide light weight SysMLv2 models 

* showcases best practices or bad examples

* provide correct SysMLv2 models for tool creators (especially parsers) e.g. to
apply smart algorithms on SysML 

* help teaching students and industrial practicioners by showing good and bad
  examples 
  
* help to train LLMs to better understand SysMLv2 models

* act as a useful library of reusable models

The main reason therefore is that we scientists and the tool vendors need models
they can build on. It is, therefore, our obligation to not only passively use
these existing models, but also actively contribute new SysMLV2 models or
improved versions. 

# How to Contribute

We are actively seeking contributions to grow this collection! If you have some
SysMLv2 models you'd like to share, we really ask and encourage you to submit
them via pull requests. All contributions are welcome, whether it's a new model
or an improvement to an existing one. 

To contribute:

* fork this repository.
* create your own directory and add your SysMLv2 model as a textual model
  (extension `.sysml`) 
* add a markdown-file to describe the models (as detailed as you like, we
  currently do not impose a specific form or meta-data)
* If you are uneasey with the standard license of this repo, you may attach your
  own license as `LICENSE.md` in your own(!) directory. 
* submit a pull request with a small description of your addition.

Alternative contributions might also just be a markdown file containing a link
to any other open source, where models can be found.

If you're unsure about how to contribute or have any questions, feel free to
contact us at tautz@se-rwth.de. 

# Community building

We intend to meet and discuss about further maintenance of the repo and its
SysML models e.g. in the contect of the MODELS conference or similar
GfSE-related events. 

# Licenses

We chose the liberal BSD 2-Clause license for the repository, to encurage open sharing of
models. 

As said: If this License does not suit you, but you still want to publish your
model it is possible to add a different license for the models of a top-level
subdirectory. All models in the repository fall under the license of the
subdirectory they are contained in.
