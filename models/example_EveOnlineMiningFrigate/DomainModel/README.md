# Domain Model
## Prompts
- You are a SysMLv2 modeler. I need to model a mining frigate in eve online. The first task I ask you to complete is to list a set of domain objects for the mining frigate, along with their definitions.
- capture these domain objects in SysML v2 in a package definition with parts and attributes. Add as well the required associations and multiplicity
- Describe a few use cases for the mining frigate
- Add the nouns in the use cases to the list of domain objects (e.g. pilot, asteroid belt, asteroid, ore, hostile ships, etc)
- Please update the SysML v2 model to reflect these additional domain objects together with associations and multiplicity
- Some of these domain objects are items and not parts like "Course" or "Threat". Update them in the list of domain objects and update the SysML v2 model accordingly.
- The domain objects are now complete. Remember them as the "Domain Objects".
- Some of the domain objects are not part of the mining frigate, like the Station, HostileShip, Asteroid, AsteroidBelt, Pilot or Drones. These are external to the mining frigate. Correct the associations and update the SysML v2 model
- remember this result as the "Updated Domain Objects"
- Now you will analyze and define the MoE of the Mining Corporation. For this you need to:  1) define the business case of the enterprise and define a ConOps.  2) identify cause-effect phenomena and finally  3) what parameters have the highest relevance to maximize the effectiveness of the enterprise. These are the MoE.
