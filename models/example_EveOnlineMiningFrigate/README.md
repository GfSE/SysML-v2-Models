# Mining Corporation Analysis and Measures of Effectiveness

## 1. Cause-Effect Phenomena

| Cause | Effect |
| ----- | ------ |
| High ore purity in asteroid belts or wormholes	| Increased revenue per unit of ore extracted. |
| Efficient mining operations	| Higher ore yield and reduced operational costs. |
| Rapid threat detection and mitigation	| Lower risk of frigate loss and downtime. |
| Sufficient pilot experience	| Improved decision-making, higher ore yield, and safer operations. |
| Adequate resupply capabilities	| Longer operational uptime and reduced downtime for resupply. |
| Poorly maintained equipment	| Reduced mining efficiency and increased risk of system failure. |
| High concentration of hostile ships	| Increased operational risk and potential losses. |
| Optimized deployment of mining frigates	| Reduced idle time and more efficient mining coverage across asteroid belts or wormholes. |
| Overlapping mining operations in one belt	| Reduced yield due to resource depletion from competing frigates. |
| Station storage capacity	| Limits the amount of ore that can be delivered and sold. |

## 2. Risk vs. Reward by Operational Area
Location	Ore Value (ISK/unit)	ISK/hour	Risk Level	Recommendation
High Sec	~400-500 ISK	~4M-6M ISK/hour	Low	Best for low-risk, steady income and beginners.
Low Sec	~1,500 ISK	~8M-12M ISK/hour	Medium to High	Moderate profitability; requires scouting.
Null Sec	~4,500-6,000 ISK	~20M-50M ISK/hour	High	High reward; requires alliance support.
Wormholes	~4,500-6,000 ISK	~20M-80M ISK/hour	Very High	Very profitable; requires cloaking and protection.
Summary of Recommendations

### High Sec:

Ideal for safe, steady operations and training new pilots.
Focus on common ores like Veldspar and Scordite for consistent income.

### Low Sec:

Moderate risk, higher reward with ores like Kernite and Hemorphite.
Use Ventures with warp stabilizers, scout ahead, and avoid gate camps.

### Null Sec:

High-value ores like Arkonor and Crokite.
Requires strong alliance support, intel channels, and protection fleets.

### Wormholes:

Extreme profitability but very high risk.
Use Tech 2 mining frigates (Prospect/Endurance) with cloaking for survival.
Coordinate with corpmates and always have exit bookmarks.
