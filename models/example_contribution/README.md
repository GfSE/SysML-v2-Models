# Example Models

These are simple example models used to illustrate the process of contributing. Please add a markdown file describing your contribution.


# Example Contribution

If you want to contribute models to the collection, you can do so in an new
folder like this one. The models should have a ".sysml" extension. If you want
to share your models with a different license, add the LICENSE.md to the folder.

To contribute

* fork this repository.
* create a directory like this one and add your SysMLv2 model as a textual model
  (extension `.sysml`) 
* add a markdown-file to describe the models (as detailed as you like, we
  currently do not impose a specific form or meta-data)
* If you are uneasey with the standard license of this repo, you may attach your
  own license as `LICENSE.md` in your own(!) directory. 
* submit a pull request with a description of your addition.
