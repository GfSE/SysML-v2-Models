# System-of-systems
This package defines a system-of-systems as an aggregation of systems in the context of their respective owning enterprises using SysMLv2 notation
As per SEHB5 Section 4.3.6 Systems of Systems (SoS) "Each constituent system [..] having its own development, management goals, and resources"

If any of the systems in consideration are contextualized within a second enterprise or mission as opposite to be systems used-for-the-purpose of only one particular enterprise at one particular time, we have a SoS to be managed.
